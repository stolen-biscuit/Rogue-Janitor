Rogue Janitor

As always it is the unsung heroes that keep the ship runnig smoothly. The dungeon is no different.

You're a one-armed goblin from Grolig, and one of the Dungeon of Ooolag's custodial staff. Ooolag the Demon King took all the monsters out to party after the last wave of heroes were defeated and you completely forgot to clean the dungeon before next shift arrives! The heroes are on their way and if they find the dungeon already defeated, they will never return and the dungeon will be abandoned. 


Clean it up bOoolag is on his way but he has stopped off for his morning coffee, giving you a chance to rush through each level and clean up before Ooolag arrives and fires you.

Game Loop:
You have to run in and clean every room in a dungeon. You have to throw away bodies and junk, refill chests and return each levels collectible to it's mantle.

Each level you get a run sheet, explaining the layout of the level, the collectible and how many monster bodies were left behind. You will have about 3-5 minutes for each level, each level will get progressively larger.
