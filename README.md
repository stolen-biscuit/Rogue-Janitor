Like all things in this world, the ones who keep things alive are the ones who receive the least appreciation or recognition.

In Rogue Janitor you play as Grolig, the Goblin Janitor. You work for Ooolag the Demon King in his Dungeon as one of the custodial staff.

After defeating the last wave of Human Heroes, Ooolag took everyone out for drinks to celeberate. Things got a bit out of hand, and now it's 2pm, you're hungover and you realise you forgot to clean up the dungeon before next shift!

Rush through the dungeon levels and tidy up before the next wave of humans arrive, if the humans arrive before you're finished cleaning and resetting the treasure you'll get fired and the Dungeon will shut down!
